### Reccomend of namming

```c
#define UART_TXD_PINNUM (10) // all caps for constant

void robot_response(int32_t id_command, uint8_t *message); // name of variable and function write in lower case. Multiword is linked by "_"

typedef struct {
 ....  
} foo_tst; // _t => typedef and _st => struct
struct {
 ....
} foo_st; // _st => struct
typedef enum {
 ....   
} foo_e; // _e => enum
```

### Data type in C

â€‹    Have 3 main groups:

* Integer: Integer variable is used to store _binary-number_ (convert from _decimal-number_).

* Floating point numbers:

* Floating point numbers:

  ![](./assets/image/1_3.png)
* String type:

  Base on array of chars (uint8_t), and each element store integer value which stand for each character in ASCII table.

### Assignment

Include 2 types:

#### 		Implicit assignment

When you assign variable in the same group of type. The assignment from integer variable to floating point also _implicit_. Because in this case, compiller has specific function to define it.

Moreover assignment from bigger-size to smaller-size data type also _implicit_, so it is possible for _implicit assignment_ to lose information.

#### 		Explicit assignment

When you assign variables with type casting,  from different group of data types. And it is user define.

[Type Conversion in C]: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/type-conversion-c/



```c
int <== unsigned int // Implicit assignment
long long <= int // Implicit assignment
double <== float // Implicit assignment
float <== int // Implicit assignment
    
int a;
float b;
char c = (char)(a + 10); // Explicit assignment
a = (int)b;  // Explicit assignment
```

**Quiz:** 

```c
int32_t int_var = 2012345678; // max of this type is 2147483647
float flt_var = int_var;
```

Does the program have error? And does the value of _flt_var_ equal to _int_var_?

**Answer:**

**No**, it doesn't. And the value of _flt_var_ is **not equal** to _int_var_. Because of feature of floating point. The integer number stored in **32 bit** memory must convert to **23 bit** (size of mantissa) in float type. In this case, **2012345678** take more than **23 bit** in integer memory . So the data after convert will be lose a bit and difference from value in _int_var_.

### Declare and Define

**Declare **of a variable is for informing to the compiler the following information: name of the variable, type of value it holds and the initial value if any it takes. i.e.,

**Define** of a variable says where the variable gets stored. i.e., memory for the variable is allocated during the definition of the variable. _Declare_ and _define_ can take places at the same time

```c
unsigned int foo; // Declare a variable
foo = 999; // Define a variable

int add(int arg1, int arg2); // Declare a function
int add(int arg1, int arg2) {
return arg1 + arg2;
}// Define a function
```

### Number literal

_The values_ you give to variable when defining, are implicit in some standard type .  This is called  _**non-suffix**_, ex: int, double,...

```c
int int_var = 8; // 8 ==> int
float pi = 3.14 // 3.14 ==> double
```

So, if you want define those _values_ with another data type, you must add **suffix**:

```c
long long a = 3210123456789LL; // LL ==> long long
unsigned long b = 1234567890123456789ul; //ul or lu are all accepted ==>unsigned long
float pi = 3.14f; // f ==> float
// suffix does not case sensitve. F = f, ul = UL
```

### Signed and unsigned number

This is how the signed number is located in memory: _two's complement_

![](./assets/image/2_1.png)

**Quiz:**

```c
unsigned int unsign_var = -1;
printf("%u", unsign_var); 
```

What is the result was print?

_**Answer:**_

Negative numbers are stored as _two's complement_:

Besides, **unsign_var** is unsigned variable, it just understand data like unsigned number.  So the answer is 2^32-1 = **4.294.967.295**. -maximum number of _unsigned int_.
